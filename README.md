Senior project by Alan Sam and Alessandra Mangialardo. A reddit-style forum page focusing on allowing users to ask questions and answer previous questions, engaging with an audience about tips and tricks on different sections about life. These include, but are not limited to: finance, education, lifestyle, gym, relationships, health, among others.

This platform was created by an interdisciplinary team of two undergraduate students as a question-and-answer forum style website. The focus of the website were three main features- posting, clapping, and commenting, where users are able to interact with each other with the intention of answering each others' questions and reading others' answers. This website was created using React, Node.js, with Firebase as the database service. JavaScript and HTML/CSS are the main languages used, alongside node modules to implement the features. Users are able to create an account in the platform, create a post, interact (clap and comment) with others' posts, and view their posts.
